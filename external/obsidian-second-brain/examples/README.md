# Sample vault

This folder shows what an obsidian-second-brain vault looks like in practice. Every note inside `sample-vault/` follows the AI-first rule defined in [`references/ai-first-rules.md`](../references/ai-first-rules.md).

If you are evaluating the skill, browse the files here before installing. If you are contributing a new command, match the structure shown in the note type closest to your output.

## What's in here

```
sample-vault/
├── _CLAUDE.md                                       # Vault operating manual (the file /obsidian-init writes)

```

A real vault would also have `Companies/`, `Decisions/`, `Knowledge/`, `Research/`, `Boards/`, and `social-media/` folders. Those are referenced in wikilinks here but not included as files — a 7-file sample is enough to show the AI-first pattern without bloating the repo.

## What to look for

Each file demonstrates the 7 rules from the AI-first spec:

1. **Self-contained context** — every note explains itself without relying on backlinks alone
2. **`## For future Claude` preamble** — the 2-3 sentence summary right after the frontmatter
3. **Rich frontmatter** — `type`, `date`, `tags`, `ai-first: true`, plus type-specific fields
4. **Recency markers per claim** — external facts carry `(as of YYYY-MM, source.com)`
5. **Sources verbatim** — URLs preserved inline, not paraphrased
6. **Mandatory `[[wikilinks]]`** — every person, project, idea linked
7. **Confidence levels** — `stated | high | medium | speculation` where applicable

## Important note about the content

Everything here is fictional. **Alex Rivera**, **Sam Patel**, **Tide**, **Currentscale Labs**, and the cited URLs are made up. Do not treat any claim in this folder as a real fact about a real person or product. The point is to show structure and tone, not to provide research.

## How to use this for your own vault

You don't copy this folder into your vault. The skill builds your vault for you when you run `/obsidian-init` and grows it through normal usage of the 31 commands. This folder exists only to show what the output looks like before you install.

If you want a clean starting point, run:

```
/obsidian-init
```

That writes a real `_CLAUDE.md` tailored to your name, your projects, and your folder preferences.
